# Changelog

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Persistent Blacklist**: Active domain-level blacklisting (`src/utils/blacklist.py`) for domains consistently returning HTTP 404/403/Cloudflare challenge errors.
- **Session Persistence**: Implemented `SessionManager` (`src/utils/session.py`) for caching and loading cookies across run sessions.
- **Dynamic Domain Configurations**: Replaced hardcoded domains in `src/config.py` and `src/core/engine.py` with dynamic loaded configuration profiles from `data/domain_config.json`.
- **Dynamic Referer and Header Overrides**: Decoupled domain-specific HTTP header bypasses into the `referer_overrides` mapping in `data/domain_config.json`.
- **Dynamic Blacklisting Circuit Breaker Persistence**: Integrated domain blacklisting hooks (`add_to_blacklist`) with `HttpClient`'s 429 and error-rate circuit breaker thresholds, saving domain bans to the persistent JSON blacklist dynamically.
- **Fast-fail broken media URLs**: Added `is_broken_media_url` to quickly bypass placeholder, 404, or empty media links without making HTTP requests.
- **Pre-flight HEAD Checks**: Integrated validation HEAD requests in `MediaDownloader` (`src/storage/file_downloader.py`) to verify media exists before streaming downloads, significantly reducing bandwidth and error logging.
- **Aggressive Throttling & Deprioritization**: Configured crawler state to permanently deprioritize/throttle domains with extremely low yields (<2% after 20 pages).

### Fixed

- **Google Images NameError**: Added missing import of `is_thumbnail_url` in `_extract_media_from_json` within `src/scraper/google_images.py`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added (Unreleased)

- Seed manifest parser (`src/core/seed_manifest.py`): `# Rate-limit:` and `# skip-link-discovery` annotations
- `DomainProfile` fields: `min_image_size`, `thumbnail_prefix_pattern`, `requires_referer`
- Quality filter functions: `safe_join()`, `has_low_res_path_pattern()`, `_video_resolution_hint()`
- Engine: `has_low_res_path_pattern` / `thumbnail_prefix_pattern` checks in BFS loop, `RLock` for `add_rejected()`, `add_rejected()` dedup + count, `run_metadata` + `duration_seconds` in `ScrapeResult`
- Downloader: `referer`, `min_image_size`, `thumbnail_prefix_pattern` support in `_download_file`
- Robots: netloc caching via `self._parsers` dict
- **Tests**: Mock signatures updated; new tests for `safe_join`, `has_low_res_path_pattern`, `_video_resolution_hint`, dedup rejection counting

### Fixed (Unreleased)

- None-current `" ".join(...)` calls in filters replaced with `safe_join()` guard against None field concatenation
- Deadlock potential in engine.py resolved: `Lock` → `RLock` for nested critical sections
- Robots.txt cache: `@lru_cache` → per-netloc dict (`self._parsers`) for thread-safety

### Changed (Unreleased)

- `_download_file` signature expanded to accept `referer`, `min_image_size`, `thumbnail_prefix_pattern`
- Engine `_scrape_images` passes domain-level `min_image_size` / `thumbnail_prefix_pattern` to downloader
- Main entry stores `duration_seconds` via `time.monotonic()` and `run_metadata` dict on each result

### Security / Repository Hygiene

- `.gitignore` streamlined for production sweeps (block scratch files, temp logs, run outputs)
- Documentation updated: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `USAGE.md`, `QUALITY_FILTERS.md`, `SCENARIOS.md`

- Test suite for performance quality features (`test_performance_quality_features.py`): zero-yield cutoff, low-yield threshold, path-based low-res detection, robots cache
- Test suite for audit trail (`test_audit_trail.py`): default audit fields, engine in-place mapping, stealth timed block, shopping/json filters, CSV columns
- Advanced async HTTP session handling (`test_advanced_features.py`): sticky cookies rotation, adaptive throttling, circuit breaker
- Stealth circuit breaker tests (`test_stealth_circuit_breaker.py`): fallback to Crawl4AI after repeated 429s
- **Quality filters**: yield-based domain filtering, low-yield detection at 30% threshold
- **Robots checker**: 404 fast-fail, netloc-scoped parser cache
- **Post-run report**: full dump of metadata (workers, page limit, crawl depth, max results, entity tokens, download flag)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added (0.4.0)

- Enhanced image dimension extraction (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP all variants)
- `parse_srcset` for highest-res selection

- Adaptive concurrency throttling on HTTP 429
- Self-healing semantic selectors fallback chain
- Shopping/media site link extraction (Pinterest, Instagram, Flickr, Etsy, etc.)
- `crawl4ai` fallback for JS-rendered pages
- **Download retries**: configurable via `tenacity` with exponential backoff, network/server error separation
- **Stream downloader**: early-abort on invalid headers (content-type, content-length)
- **Stealth mode**: multi-session rotation, cookie jar isolation, configurable user-agent pool
- **Tests**: download retry, stealth mode, enhanced features, advanced crawl scenarios
